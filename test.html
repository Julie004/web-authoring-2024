      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I'm Julie Torres, a 19-year-old from Dallas, TX, specifically Oak Cliff. Currently, I'm juggling the responsibilities of a full-time Merchandising Manager role at Five Below while pursuing my degree. Outside of work and studies, I find joy in playing with my two adorable dogs and indulging in my passion for baking. Currently, I'm dedicated to my studies, pursuing a degree that aligns with my aspirations. An internship with IBM during the summer of 2022 was a significant milestone, and with the completion of my degree on the horizon, I'm eager to return to IBM and continue contributing to the tech world.</p>
