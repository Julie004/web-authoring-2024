        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Julie Torres, a 19-year-old from Dallas, TX, specifically Oak Cliff. Currently, I'm juggling the
            responsibilities of a full-time Merchandising Manager role at Five Below while pursuing my degree. Outside
            of work and studies, I find joy in playing with my two adorable dogs and indulging in my passion for baking.
            Currently, I'm dedicated to my studies, pursuing a degree that aligns with my aspirations. An internship
            with <abbr title="International Business Machines">IBM</abbr> during the summer of 2022 was a significant
            milestone, and with the completion of my degree on the horizon, I'm eager to return to IBM and continue
            contributing to the tech world.</p>
        <p>Something I don't normally tell people is that I was born on a leap year. Being born on a leap year has
            always added a unique twist to my life. While I technically celebrate my birthday every four years, turning
            five this year feels like a special milestone. It's like having a secret code embedded in my birth date,
            making it stand out among the rest. Explaining the concept of leap years to others has become a fun and
            recurring conversation topic. People often find it fascinating, and I've come to embrace the quirks that
            come with being born on such an uncommon date. It adds a touch of rarity to my identity, making each
            birthday celebration all the more memorable.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I absolutely love spending my free time engaged in various activities that bring me joy and relaxation. One
            of my favorite pastimes is playing soccer and volleyball, not for any professional aspirations, but purely
            for the thrill of the game and the camaraderie it brings. There's something about the rush of energy on the
            field or the sandy court that allows me to unwind and enjoy the physical activity. It's a fantastic way to
            stay active and maintain a healthy lifestyle while having a blast with friends.</p>
        <p>When I'm not running around on the sports field, you can find me in the kitchen, baking up a storm. I've
            developed a genuine passion for creating delicious treats, from cookies and cakes to pastries. Baking is not
            just a hobby for me; it's a form of creative expression where I can experiment with flavors and techniques.
            The satisfaction of sharing these homemade delights with my family and friends is incomparable.
            Additionally, I'm not one to shy away from a friendly video game session, especially when it involves some
            quality bonding time with my two younger brothers. The combination of sports, baking, and gaming truly
            reflects the diverse and enjoyable aspects of my life outside of work and academic pursuits.</p>

        <h2>Professional Goal</h2>
        <p>Despite my current role, my passion lies in technology, and I am actively working towards aligning my career
            with this interest. As part of my degree plans, I have embarked on a journey to explore opportunities in the
            tech industry. My experience interning at IBM during the summer of 2022 was enriching, providing me with
            valuable insights into the dynamic world of technology. The exposure fueled my aspiration to build a career
            in a tech-related field.</p>
        <p>While I thoroughly enjoyed my time at IBM, I am also eager to explore opportunities with American Airlines.
            The decision to intern with IBM was a strategic choice, and now, as I approach the end of my degree, I am
            considering the possibility of exploring opportunities with American Airlines as well. My goal is to secure
            a tech-related position that not only matches my educational background but also allows me to contribute my
            skills and enthusiasm to a dynamic and innovative industry. As I navigate the job market, I am excited about
            the prospects of finding a role that not only aligns with my degree but also offers room for growth and
            learning in the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>
