        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Julie Torres, a 19-year-old from Dallas, TX, specifically Oak Cliff. Currently, I'm juggling the responsibilities of a full-time Merchandising Manager role at Five Below while pursuing my degree. Outside of work and studies, I find joy in playing with my two adorable dogs and indulging in my passion for baking. Currently, I'm dedicated to my studies, pursuing a degree that aligns with my aspirations. An internship with IBM during the summer of 2022 was a significant milestone, and with the completion of my degree on the horizon, I'm eager to return to IBM and continue contributing to the tech world.</p>

        <h2>Professional Goal</h2>
        <p>Despite my current role, my passion lies in technology, and I am actively working towards aligning my career with this interest. As part of my degree plans, I have embarked on a journey to explore opportunities in the tech industry. My experience interning at IBM during the summer of 2022 was enriching, providing me with valuable insights into the dynamic world of technology. The exposure fueled my aspiration to build a career in a tech-related field.</p>
        <p>While I thoroughly enjoyed my time at IBM, I am also eager to explore opportunities with American Airlines. The decision to intern with IBM was a strategic choice, and now, as I approach the end of my degree, I am considering the possibility of exploring opportunities with American Airlines as well. My goal is to secure a tech-related position that not only matches my educational background but also allows me to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to a dynamic and innovative industry. As I navigate the job market, I am excited about the prospects of finding a role that not only aligns with my degree but also offers room for growth and learning in the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>
